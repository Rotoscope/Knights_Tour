```
Most likely, the preceding program produced a relatively short tour. Now modify your program to
attempt 1000 tours. Use a one-dimensional array to keep track of the number of tours of each length. 
When your program finishes attempting the 1000 tours, it should print this information in neat tabular 
format. What was the best result?

*This code uses bits to flag if a location has been checked before.

CECS282 Knight's Tour Part B

```
Now letâ€™s develop a program that will move the knight around a chessboard. The board is
represented by an 8-by-8 two-dimensional array board. Each of the squares is initialized to zero. We 
describe each of the eight possible moves in terms of both their horizontal and vertical components.

Keep a counter that varies from 1 to 64. Record the latest count in each square the knight moves to.
Remember to test each potential move to see if the knight has already visited that square, and, of 
course, test every potential move to make sure that the knight does not land off the chessboard. Now 
write a program to move the knight around the chessboard. Run the program. How many moves did the 
knight make?

Output:
28 07 16 00 00 00 00 00 
15 00 27 08 00 00 00 00

CECS282 Knight's Tour Part C

```
Now write a version of the Knightâ€™s Tour program using the accessibility heuristic. At any time, the
knight should move to the square with the lowest accessibility number. In case of a tie, the knight may 
move to any of the tied squares. Therefore, the tour may begin in any of the four corners.

Run this version of your program. Did you get a full tour? Now modify the
program to run 64 tours, one starting from each square of the chessboard. How many full tours did you 
get?

Output:
Total full tours made : 63
